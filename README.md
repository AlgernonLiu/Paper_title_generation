# Paper_title_generation
This repository contains the code and resources for a project focused on generating paper titles from abstracts in Chinese. The project uses a fine-tuned mT5 model to perform the summarization task, aiming to provide accurate and concise titles based on the given abstracts.

** Features **
1. Pre-trained Models: Utilizes the HeackMT5-ZhSum100k model for initial training and evaluation.
2. Fine-tuning: Includes multiple fine-tuned versions of the model to improve performance on specific datasets.
3. Evaluation Metrics: Employs ROUGE metrics to evaluate the performance of the models.
4. Data Processing: Includes scripts for preprocessing CSL datasets and tokenizing the text for model input.
5. Training and Evaluation: Scripts and configurations for training the models and evaluating their performance on test datasets.
